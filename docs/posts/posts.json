The article I linked, describes what data scientist had to go through and what techniques were used for COVID-19. In the article it mentions that data scientist are crucial when it comes to assisting medical research and monitoring real time spreading of COVID-19. Personally I think this is pretty neat, the idea of helping those through data is a concept that Iâ€™m unfamiliar to. I always thought data scientists were more of a business aspect rather then medical research, but I was wrong. The article also mentions that the use of A.I. helped in modeling predictions for COVID-19. It helped provide useful insights to the spread of COVID-19. Overall, I like the idea of data scientists putting their skills into helping people, it may not seem like much compared to doctors or nurses, but information is important, especially when the world is going through an epidemic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
